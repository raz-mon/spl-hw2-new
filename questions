- Do the join() commands damage the conccurancy of our program? Seems not (by definitios of "t1.join()" that we saw on the internet. Make sure.
- What does it mean when we put Future<?>?? (What does the ? mean). See MsgBusImpl.
- Do we need to use interrupt()?? Why not just wait for the explotion broadcast? It's just another option, but I don't see any reason to use this in our project..
- An explanation about the "target" file and all what's going on in the project files wold be grate. What is The "Idea" file?
- Is the red line on the pom-file o.k?
- Where do i save the output and how do i call it? Did we do this correct? It is unclear to me.
- ConcurrentmodficationError.
- How will the tests be performed? Meaning do we have to erase all Eeoks, Queues, and so on.
- Do we need to put synchronized in subscribeEvent\Broadcast?

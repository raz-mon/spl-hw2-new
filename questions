- What does it mean when we put Future<?>?? (What does the ? mean). See MsgBusImpl.
- Can we implement Diary as a SingleTone Class?
- Where do i save the output and how do i call it?
-why does attackEvent return to src each and every time, even though we deleted it.



- What does the use of the CallBack function look like?
- Watch again the ps where dolav explains this (If he did)!

-  What is a "marker" iterface?

-  Does the fact that the message-bus class is singletone affect the tests i perform on it? If so, how?
  ans: Yes, it is indeed singleton and we have to write the code that makes it that way. And test it.
-  More important facts about messageBus Class (important for tests and implementation): 
  2.1. Singletione.
  2.2. Thread-safe.
  2.3. Cant alter any of the given methods from the interface.
  2.4. Can't add methods to this interface.
-  Make sure we write tests for MessageBusImpl and not for MessageBus.
  ans: Yes.
-  Does each time futureTest run it is setUp this class or use run iterativily all the methods
  Ans: Separated for each test.
-  Can we make a CTR for Ewok so that the initial value for available is true? (We have to...).
  ans: Yes. Required to.
-  Need to make a public method "getInstance" for MessageBusImpl in order to make it singletone.
  ans: Right. Do that.
